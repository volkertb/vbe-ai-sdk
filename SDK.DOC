    INTRODUCTION:

        This document describes the VESA VBE/AI Software Developers
        Kit as found on the VBE/AI SDK release diskette. Included
        are sample WAVE drivers for the Pro Audio Spectrum, Disney
        Sound Source, and Sound Blaster cards.  Also included are
        sample MIDI drivers for the OPL2, OPL3 FM chip, and Roland
        MPU-401 MIDI transmitter/receiver.

        The VBE/AI specification may be purchased directly from the
	VESA office. To order a copy, call (408)435-0333.

        Each body of code is as complete as possible for the 1.00
        revision of the VBE/AI specification. The code may still
        change to match any changes when the specification is
        adopted, or to fix bugs.


    ADDITIONAL PROGRAMMING NOTES/CLARIFICATIONS:

        The Pascal calling conventional permits Pascal functions
        the right to modify the working registers AX, BX, CX, and DX.
        Your code must save these registers, if necessary, before calling
        any of the VBE/AI Pascal function calls.


    EXAMPLE DRIVERS:

        The VBE/AI example drivers were written as DOS TSRs. There
        is one API per TSR. Each one must be loaded separately into
        memory. The program, SETPREF.EXE lets the user assign a
        preference level to each driver.


    LOADING SAMPLE DRIVERS:

        Each driver uses a common set of command line parameters. The
        set looks like this:

            /H      helps
            /?      helps
            /B:dd   board # if multiple boards are present
            /A:xx   board address
            /D:xx   dma channel
            /I:dd   irq channel
            /MB:xx  memory base (segment)
            /MR:xx  memory range
            /P:dd   user preference setting
            /U      unload this driver from memory

                dd=decimal #, xx=hex #


        To load a driver, just run the program. The program decides
        if the hardware is present, then will stay resident. The
        VBE/AI architecture does allow resident TSR drivers to be
        unloaded. Only the first driver loaded will be permenantly
        resident, all others may unload. The available drivers are:

            PASWAVE.COM - Pro Audio Spectrum WAVE driver
            SSWAVE.COM  - Disney Sound Source driver
            SBWAVE.COM  - Sound Blaster & Compatible driver
            OPL2.COM    - OPL2 MIDI driver
            MPU.COM     - MPU-401 driver

        NOTE: For now, use of the command line switches to setup DMA
        and IRQ settings are required to properly function. In retail
        versions of VBE/AI drivers, the manufacture's installation
        software will make these setup decisions.


    RUNNING SAMPLE APPLICATIONS:

        There are five sample programs currently available in the
        SDK. The source for each program is included on the
        diskette. Two programs test the WAVE drivers, two test the
        MIDI drivers, and the last is a utility for both setting
        user preference levels and displaying the current installed
        driver list.


    NOTE.EXE

        This program allows the user to enter a channel and note
        number to be loaded into the target MIDI device. Once the
        patch has been loaded, a menu of functions will be provided
        to allow the user to turn the note ON or OFF.

        To Use:  DOS>note [Pxx]

        Where:   [Pxx] is the user preference #.

        NOTE: all values are zero based, so the key number ranges
              from 0 to 127. Channels range from 0 to 15. Channel
              number 9 is the percussive channel.

    PLAY.EXE

        This program accepts a list of up to 10 small (under 64k)
        .WAV files, presents a list to the user, and plays the
        selected file.

        Copyright (c) 1993,1994  VESA, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

        To Use:  DOS>play [file.wav] [file.wav] [file.wav]...

        Where: [file.wav] is a list of up to 10 files to play.


    PMIDI.EXE

        This program will play any type 0 or type 1 MIDI file. The
        file must be under 64k in size. Currently, the program
        requires the driver's patch library to be resident in the
        current directory, specfically, OPL2.BNK. This version can
        only handle patch banks under 64K, but will soon support
        unlimited sizes. The following is a dump of the banner and
        command line parameter list:

        Copyright (c) 1993,1994  VESA, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

        To Use:  DOS>pmidi [song] [H] [L] [Mxxx] [K{+|-xx}] [R{+|-xx}] [V{xx}]

        Where: [song] is the .MID file to be played
           [H]        High end synth playing on channels 1-10.
           [I]        to receive MIDI input only.
           [K{+|-}xx] shifts all key #s up|down by xx count (cheap transpose).
           [L]        Low end synth playing on channels 11-16.
           [Mxxxx]    patch Map file name (256 bytes for 2 tables).
           [Pxx]      selects a VBE device at this (xx) user preference level.
           [R{+|-}xx] shifts all patch #s up|down by xx count.
           [T+|-xx]   Tempo shift faster (+) or (-) slower, in percent.
           [V{xx}]    verbose mode to dump events as they play. xx can be 1-5.


    SETPREF.EXE

        This program allows the user to set his/her preference level
        to each driver. This allows the application to choose which
        driver is the most desirable to use. Also, the program shows
        a listing of the driver configuration. The following is a
        dump of the banner and command line parameter list:


        VESA VBE/AI Preference setting Program, 01.00
        Copyright (c) 1993,1994  VESA, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

        To Use: DOS>SETPREF [H|?] [L] [+] [+xx] [-] [-xxx] [Vxxx]

        Where: [L]        lists all devices.
               [+]        increments all preference levels by 1
               [+xxx]     increments a specific devices's preference.
               [-]        decrements all preference levels by 1
               [-xxx]     decrements a specific devices's preference.
               [Vxx]      give a verbose listing of this driver.

        NOTE: The highest preference level is zero (0), so incrementing the
              preference actually lowers the user preference, and visa versa.


    TESTW.EXE

        This program tests the WAVE output of a given driver. It
        allows the user to specify a starting block size,
        incremental length, number of times to play the block, and
        more. The program will send the block to the driver, and
        wait for the appropriate callback within a fixed amount of
        time. This time depends upon the sample rate and block size.
        The following is a dump of the banner and command line
        parameter list:


        VESA VBE/AI WAVE Output Test Program, 01.00
        Copyright (c) 1993,1994  VESA, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

        To Use:  DOS>play [16] [Axxx] [Fxxx] [Dxxx] [Ixxx] [Lxxx] [R] [S] [Txxx]

        Where: [16] enables 16 bit audio (8 bit is default).
            [Axxx]  uses PlayCont/RecordCont. xxx is an optional block size.
            [Fxxx]  user selects an alternate .WAV/.VOC file by the name of xxx.
            [Dxxx]  allows for delays between blocks of xxx clock ticks (18.2tps).
            [Ixxx]  after each block, Increment the next length by xxx.
            [Lxxx]  block Length of first pcm block.
            [R]     Reload the sample rate after each block finishes.
            [S]     selects Stereo mode operation.
            [Txxx]  number of Times to play the block.


    TESTR.EXE

        This program tests the WAVE input of a given driver. It
        allows the user to specify a starting block size,
        incremental length, number of times to play the block, and
        more. The program will send the block to the driver, and
        wait for the appropriate callback within a fixed amount of
        time. This time depends upon the sample rate and block size.

        To Use:  DOS>rec  [16] [Axxx] [Fxxx] [Dxxx] [Ixxx] [Lxxx] [O{+}] [R] [S] [Txxx]

        Where: [16] enables 16 bit audio (8 bit is default).
            [Axxx]  uses PlayCont/RecordCont. xxx is an optional block size.
            [Fxxx]  user selects a new File by the name of xxx.
            [Dxxx]  allows for delays between blocks of xxx clock ticks (18.2tps).
            [Ixxx]  after each block, Increment the next length by xxx.
            [Lxxx]  block Length of first pcm block.
            [O{+}]  Save one recorded block. '+' saves all blocks.
            [R]     Reload the sample rate after each block finishes.
            [S]     selects Stereo mode operation.
            [Txxx]  number of Times to play the block.


    COMPILING SAMPLE SOURCE CODE:

        All the example code was developed using Microsoft 'C' and
        MASM Assember.  Debugging of the TSR's was done using
        Nu-Mega's Soft-ICE and applications using Codeview. To build
        the code, use the included batch files and MAKE files.
        Again, the MAKE files depend upon the above directory
        structure to build the executables. The following list
        describes the files needed to build this driver release:

        1. The file 'MKSDK.BAT' executes several MAKE sequences
           to build the VBE/AI SDK program set.

        2. The file 'MAKEFILE' is the general make file to
           compile the five sample drivers.

        3. The file 'TESTW' is the make file to build the WAVE
           playback (TESTW.EXE) and record (TESTR.EXE) test programs.

        4. The file 'PLAY' is the make file to build the WAVE
           playback (PLAY.EXE) program.

        5. The file 'PMIDI' is the make file to build the MIDI
           player program.

        6. The file 'NOTE' is the make file to build the NOTE
           player program.

        7. The file 'SETPREF' is the make file to build the user
           preference adjustment program.

        8. The file 'VOLUME' is the make file to build the Volume
           control test program.
