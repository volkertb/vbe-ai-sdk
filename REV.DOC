    INTRODUCTION:

        This document details the revision history of the various
        drivers found in the VESA VBE/AI SDK and DDK.

    Revision 1.00 00.04  05/02/94

      - ALL: In INIT.ASM, changed the TSR method to use DOS int 21,
	function 31, so a return code could be passed. This return
	code returns a 1, just as the /V switch returns a 1 when hardware
	is detected. If no hardware is detected, and the driver bails, then
	a proper /V return code will be returned in that case as well.

      - ALL: The program's environment string block pointer will be
	released before the program terminates and stays resident.

      - MAIN.ASM: Corrected return condition in open code when doing 2nd
	open, or open in 32 bit mode - didn't pass back 0x014F.

      - OPL2: Inverted carry in hw_checkpatch to return proper response.

      - OPL2: Removed the loading of a default patch in OPL2, in the
	msGlobalReset routine, since every NOTE-ON will load one anyway.
	This also removed a pop when the chip was reset.

      - OPL2: Added code in wsPreLoadPatch to ingore NULL ptrs.

      - OPL2: Rewrote the channel stealing since it was ON/OFF, not
	on a channel basis.

      - OPL2: The driver has been modified to include the contents of
	OPL2.BNK, in compressed form. This only added about 2.5k, but
	traded off over 1k in the services structure, so the net gain
	was about 1.5k.

      - SBWAVE: Added code in interrupt to handle spurious interrupts.

      - SBWAVE/PASWAVE/SSWAVE: Added cli/sti to wsStopIO for protection.

      - SBWAVE/PASWAVE/SSWAVE: Fixed a bug in wsStopIO which cleared out
	wsvendor.distate before calling wsPauseIO causing wsPauseIO to fail.

      - SBWAVE/PASWAVE/SSWAVE: Fixed a bug in givesynccallback which
	referenced wsvendor.distate, when it was pass in via BL.


    Revision 1.00 00.03  04/08/94

      - NOTE: A bug was found in the WAVE SERVICES structures. The
        wsGetLastError and wsTimerTick functions were reversed in the
        structure, according to the specification. Since the specification
        sets the standard, all code will have to follow the written
        specification. This release of software reflects this change. All
        three sample drivers have been updated to reflect this change.

           vbeai.h was adjusted.
           vbeai.inc was adjusted.
           wave\api.asm was adjusted.
           wave\pas\hardware.asm was adjusted.
           wave\sb\hardware.asm was adjusted.
           wave\ss\hardware.asm was adjusted.

      - All driver software version numbers have been incremented to 03.

      - VOLUME.EXE has more messages printed to the screen to tell the
        user more about what is being performed.

      - PMIDI.EXE The cheap quantization has introduced a problem in
        processing the tracks out of order. This has been fixed by
        changing the way the delta time is handled.

      - PLAY.C has now been renamed to TESTW.EXE. The secondary program
        generated from PLAY.C was REC.EXE. This is now called TESTR.EXE.

      - PLAY.C is now a new program as an example of loading and playing
        a list of .WAV files.

      - STUB.ASM and related files have been deleted since the drivers now
        can unload if first in chain.

      - PMIDI.EXE now only sends ACTIVESENSING (a MIDI command) if
        explicitly requested, instead of as a default state.

      - PMIDI.EXE implemented a method of reducing tempo interrupt rate
        down to 300 ticks or less. This is a cheap quantization.

      - The WAVE drivers were not returning the correct pointer to the
        completed circular buffer. They were returning just the start
        of the whole buffer. The pointer now reflect the start of the
        completed division.

      - The WAVE drivers were not allowing for more than one block to
        be registered at a time. This has now been corrected to allow
        up to to 32 blocks to be registered.

      - PASWAVE.COM and SBWAVE.COM had secondary bugs where, internally,
        the block sizes were wrong for the "wsPlayBlock" and "wsRecordBlock"
        routines.

      - SSWAVE.COM had a bug that, internally, gave the wrong block
        size to play using "wsPlayBlock".

    Revision 1.00 00.02  03/09/94

      - PASWAVE.COM and SBWAVE.COM had a problem where a starting buffer
        address of 0x30008000 (linear 0x38000), with a length of 0x8000,
        was considered invalid, but now fixed.

    Revision 1.00 00.02  02/28/94

      - SBWAVE.COM has new code that parses the environment string
        BLASTER= to find the DMA, IRQ and board address.

      - Incremented the software version # in all 5 drivers, to #2. The
        banners in all the drivers now reflect version 1.02, meaning
        VBE/AI version 1, software version #02.

      - Removed dead code from PMIDI.C, just cosmetic cleanup.

      - Added a switch to PMIDI.C to allow Active Sensing output
        to MIDI devices to be disabled. The Turtle Beach Maui card
        turns off all notes when it receives Active Sensing.

      - Fixed a fatal bug in MIDI\API.ASM msPreLoadPatch. The return
        instruction left one word on the stack. Corrected by changing
        the return value from 10 to 12.

      - Fixed a fatal bug in WAVE\API.ASM wsPauseIO. The return
        instruction left one word on the stack. Corrected by changing
        the return value from nothing to 2.

      - INT 10, Query #2 was responding with volume info & services if the
        device did not actually have volume support, but now, no longer.

      - Fixed a fatal bug in WAVE\SS\HARDWARE.ASM. The volume device
        check return instruction left the parameters on the stack.
        Corrected by eliminating the volume info & services structures.

      - Fixed a fatal bug in MIDI\OPL2\HARDWARE.ASM. The volume device
        check return instruction left the parameters on the stack.
        Corrected by eliminating the volume info & services structures.

      - The first loaded TSR can now unload from memory if there are
        no other TSRs loaded after AND the INT 10 vector matches the
        first TSR's entrypoint.

      - The SBWAVE.COM driver had a bug in it where auto-init commands
        did not setup the buffer divsion via cmd 48.

      - The MPU.COM driver info structure field, milibrary, was one byte
        too long, which skewed the rest of the structure. The result was,
        the mimemreq field said 29k, instead of 69h.

      - The OPL2.COM driver didn't save/restore registers in the timer
        tick routine, so things were returned corrupted.

      - MPU.COM MIDI input callbacks had a problem in validating the
        applications callback routine. MPU.COM checked the offset instead
        of the segment, so zero based offsets didn't get called.

    Revision 1.00 00.01  02/14/94

      - 1st official release of both the SDK and DDK. All version #s
        reflect VBE/AI version 1.00, and software version #1.


    Revision 0.98 00.01:

      - This revision was available during the VESA review process, before
        the specification was ratified.
