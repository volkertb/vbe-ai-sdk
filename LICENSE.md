*On August 20, 1995, George wrote what we refer to as our "Manifatso."  Here it is.*

*Multimedia is a frontier for music. Along with the Internet, Multimedia will become important in a way that is
historically significant, for tremendous numbers of opportunities for, and different and new ways of listening to,
creating, and interacting with music.*

*As the settlers come to this frontier, it is incumbent upon us pioneers to make sure that this becomes a place that is
free and open for musical expression.  It is Team Fat's intention that the music in this place be expressive, touching,
and made for the sake of the human spirit, not repetitive, imitative, mechanical by convenience, nor needlessly enslaved
by styles imposed by fashion or limited machinery.*

*The musical precedents we set, and the tools we use and help create, the clothes we wear, the cars we drive, and the
things we say should all promote this vision.*

*<sub>[note: In January, 1995, there were 71 thousand internet domains. In January, 2007, there were over 433 million.

"multimedia".]</sub>*
