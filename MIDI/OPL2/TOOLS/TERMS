        OVERVIEW OF LICENSING TERMS FOR GENERAL MIDI TIMBRES


        The file entitled FATV10.BNK, and it's derivative OPL2.BNK,
        contain the information that defines General MIDI timbres
        (piano sound, trumpet sound, etc.) for the Yamaha chip in your
        sound card. All timbres in both FATV10.BNK and OPL2.BNK are
        Copyright (c) 1993, The Fat Man, and administered by Fat Labs,
        Inc. You may use these timbres in your product provided that
        you:

        1) Send $1 per product that contains the timbres (not $1 per
           box shipped, but a one-time, nominal charge to make our
           contract binding),

        2) put our credit on the screen when sound drivers load and in
           your paper documentation,

        3) send us a copy of your finished product, and

        4) be sure that all software that is distributed by you and
           that contains the timbres (FATV10.BNK and OPL2.BNK) also
           contains this notice and our contract (README3.TXT and
           GENMID-V.TXT) in software and paper documentation. This is
           meant to cover products such as SDK's and OEM drivers that
           will encourage the incorporation of FATV10.BNK and OPL2.BNK
           into other products. End products, such as games, that do
           not invidte further distribution of FATV10.BNK and OPL2.BNK
           need not include the .TXT files.
