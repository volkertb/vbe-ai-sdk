OVERVIEW OF LICENSING TERMS FOR GENERAL MIDI TIMBRES

The file entitled FATV10.BNK contains the information that defines General
MIDI timbres (piano sound, trumpet sound, etc.) for the Yamaha chip in your
sound card.  All timbres in FATV10.BNK are Copyright 1993 The Fat Man, and
administered by Fat Labs, Inc.  You may use these timbres in your product
provided that you:

1) send $1 per product that contains the timbres (not $1 per shipped box,
but a one-time, nominal charge to make our contract binding),

2) put our credit on screen when sound drivers load and in your paper
documentation,

3) send us a copy of your finished product, and

4) be sure that all software that is distributed by you and that contains
the timbres (FATV10.BNK) also contains this notice and our contract
(README3.TXT and GENMID-V.TXT) in software and in paper documentation.
This is meant to cover products such as SDK's and OEM drivers that will
encourage the incorporation of FATV10.BNK into other products.  End
products such as games that do not invite further distribution of
FATV10.BNK need not include the .TXT files.

Our credit should read:

"General MIDI timbres for Yamaha OPL-2- and OPL-3-based sound cards were
produced by The Fat Man(TM) and developed by K. Weston Phelan and George
Alistair Sanger.  Copyright 1993, The Fat Man(TM)"
